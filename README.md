# DemoSmartFridge
This is a miniature smart fridge system that utilizes OpenCV to identify when an item is missing inside of a refrigerator. Once it recognizes an item is missing, it will use Selenium to automate the process of placing an order for that specific missing item. Lastly, it will automatically shoot an email to the user notifying them of its purchase.
